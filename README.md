Problema:

In JavaScript or TypeScript, write a program that parses a word and returns the word with the following: first letter, number of distinct characters between first and last character, and last letter. For example, Smooth would become S3h. Words can only be composed of alphabetic characters. A few of the things we will be looking at are test scenarios including negative tests, code accuracy, and solution completeness. Please include this problem description in the comment at the top of your solution. The problem is designed to take approximately 1-2 hours and will be used as a conversation point in the verbal assessment part of your interview. Please complete the coding assessment and have your solution uploaded as soon as possible. Please upload your solution to Dropbox or a similar option and send a link to download the folder prior to your interview.”
 
Cuando lo resuelva, puede enviártelo en Github o algo similar, y entonces las presentaremos. Parte de la entrevista será en base a este test.
